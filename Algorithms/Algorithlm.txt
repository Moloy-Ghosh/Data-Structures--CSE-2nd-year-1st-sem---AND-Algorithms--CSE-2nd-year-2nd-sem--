*It is a sequence of steps that
can be followed to solve a problem.
*An algorithm takes some values as input
and produces some values as output
*An algorithm is thus a sequence of
computational steps that transform the
input into the output.

Algorithm has three basic section:
input section
Operational or processing section
Output section

There are several techniques to devise
algorithms, such as divide and conquer,
greedy,dynamic programming, back reacking
methods and so on.

Complexity of algorithm:
Time complexity (execution time)
Space complexity

For analysis of algorithm three cases
may be considered:
Best case
Average case
Worst case
