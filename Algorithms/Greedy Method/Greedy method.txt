Suppose that a problem can be solved by a sequence
of decisions. The greedy method has that each decision
is locally optimal.  These locally optimal solutions
will finally add up to a globally optimal solution.

Only a few optimization problems can be solved by
the greedy method. 

An optimization problem is one in which you want to
find, not just a solution, but the best solution.
A “greedy algorithm” sometimes works well for
optimization problems
A greedy algorithm works in phases. At each phase:
You take the best you can get right now, without regard
for future consequences
You hope that by choosing a local optimum at each step,
you will end up at a global optimum
