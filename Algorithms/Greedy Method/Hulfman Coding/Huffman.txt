Huffman coding is a method of data compression
that assigns shorter binary codes to more frequently
occurring symbols in a dataset, like characters
in a text. This helps reduce the size of the data,
making it more efficient to store or transmit.
It's a technique used in various applications,
such as file compression and data transmission, 
to save space and improve data transfer speeds.

Lossless and lossy are two different methods of
data compression, and they have distinct characteristics:

Lossless Compression:
Lossless compression is a method of reducing the
size of data without losing any information.
When you compress data using a lossless method,
you can fully recover the original data without
any loss of quality.
Examples of lossless compression algorithms include
ZIP, GZIP, and PNG (for images).

Lossy Compression:
Lossy compression is a method of reducing the
size of data by selectively discarding some
information that is considered less important or
imperceptible to the human senses.
Examples of lossy compression algorithms include
JPEG (for images), MP3 (for audio), and
MPEG (for video).
