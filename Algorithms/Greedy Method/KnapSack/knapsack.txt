Given some items, pack the knapsack to get 
the maximum total value. Each item has some 
weight and some value. Total weight that we can
carry is no more than some fixed number W.
So we must consider weights of items as well as 
their values.

There are two versions of the problem:

“Fractional knapsack problem”
Items are divisible: you can take any fraction
of an item. 

“0-1 knapsack problem”
Items are indivisible; you either take an item
or not. Some special instances can be solved
with dynamic programming.

Item		weight    	profit
1		 18		 25
2		 15		 24
3		 10		 15
Here n=3, c= 20.

Strategy 1: pick items according to maximum profit 

Item	   weight taken              profit gained               remaining weight
1              18	                  25		           20-18=2
2              2 (out of 15)           24*2/15=3.2                  20-20 = 0
3              0	   		   0			      0

Total profit gained = 25 + 3.2 =28.2

Strategy 2: picks as many items as possible. Take smallest weight items first.
