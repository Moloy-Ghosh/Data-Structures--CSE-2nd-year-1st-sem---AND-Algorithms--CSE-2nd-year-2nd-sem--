Problem:  n activities, S = {1, 2, â€¦, n},
each activity i has a start time si and
a finish time fi, si <= fi.
Activity i occupies time interval [si, fi].
i and j are compatible if sj >= fi.
The problem is to select a maximum-size
set of mutually compatible activities
Objective : selection of maximum-size
set s, which is a subset of S.
Constraint: selected activities must be
compatibles.


Example:

i   1  2  3  4  5  6  7   8   9   10  11

si  1  3  0  5  3  5  6   8   8   2   12

fi  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14

The solution  set = {1, 4, 8, 11}
