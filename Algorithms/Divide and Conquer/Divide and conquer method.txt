The divide and conquer method involves three
steps at each level of the recursion:

Divide the problem into a number of subproblems.

Conquer or solve the subproblems recursively.
If the subproblem sizes are small enough, solve
them in a straightforward manner.

Combine the solution to the subproblems to
get the solution for the original problem.Â
