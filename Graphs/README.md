<p>
  I noted here what I read from data structure and discrete math books and class. Topics according to my note:
  
  -Some definition with example (Graph, Undirected Graph, Directed Graph, Simple Graph, edge, node, Path, Cycle, Cycle Graph, Tree)
  -Isomorphism and how to check between two graph
  -Degree
  -Complete Graph
  -Bipartite Graph and how to check
  -Complete Bipartite Graph
  -Subgraphs
  -Graph Representation (how to represent with Adjacency Matrix, Incidance Matrix and Adjacency List for directed and undirected graph)
  -Bi-Connected Graph
  -Floyd Warshall's Algorithm
  -Dijkstra's Algorithm
  -DFS Algorithm
  -BFS Algorithm
  -Topological Sort
  
  Everything of my note you can get below.
